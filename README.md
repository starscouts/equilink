> The main function is just a single button, and a way to pair it with your loved ones.<br>
When you and your loved one, or loved ones, have the app open, you pushing your button makes their phones vibrate, and vice versa.<br>
A simple little way to feel the physical presence of your loved ones without being physical together since they have to physically press their button to make your phone vibrate.<br>
If the other person doesn't have the app open in the exact moment their partner presses the button, it can send them a "hey i just want you to know i'm here" notification, something along those lines.<br>
it's not strictly limited to just 1 to 1, either. you can pair with any number of loved ones and it acts the same.<br>
push button - loved ones either get vibration or notification.<br>
if you have multiple paired, you can choose to send to specific ones, or to all.<br>
Pairing with others works on a code system. You have a code, and when you share this code with others you can send friend requests, and once you've added people as friends that's when you can send notifications/vibrations to each other.

> Going off of the framework that you've started:<br>
Home is who's online, pairing/friend requests/etc<br>
Vibrate page is the one that actually has the button to send the vibration/notification to your loved one(s) and the choice of who to send it to (and had a cheesy idea of the button looking like a horseshoe or something like that, because hors, and hoof)<br>
Friends page is who you've already paired with, etc<br>
Me & settings can probably be combined... it'll be where you can do things like set your name in the app that shows for your paired friends and maybe your pairing code if it's not on one of the other pages, and whatever else we think of that needs to end up in there.

> Not sure how long the vibration should be.<br>
> As long as the button is held or once per button press?<br>
How long per button press if only once? Probably no more than a few seconds<br>
